# wortomat

Are you a writer? 

Do you often lose track of your open plot issues?

Are you drowning in your own plot?   

Then wortomat might be just the tool for you :) 


## Installation 

Easy! Clone the repository and let Maven build the thing for you: 

```
git clone https://github.com/SimoneSchaefer/wortomat.git
cd wortomat
mvn clean install
```

This will create a JAR file in the backend/target folder that you can run by

```
java -jar backend/target/backend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar 
```

Open your browser on http://localhost:8085.
